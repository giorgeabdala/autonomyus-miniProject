# Mini Project Report - Giorge Abdala

## Introduction

During this mini project, I focused on three main areas to strengthen the presence and efficiency of Autonomys within the community:

1. **Social Media Engagement:** Creation and maintenance of an official Twitter account aimed at the Portuguese-speaking audience.
2. **GitHub Contributions:** Involvement in both creating and reviewing Pull Requests in key repositories.
3. **Translation Collaboration:** Support in translating content on Crowdin into Portuguese, thus expanding material accessibility.

This report presents a detailed summary of each initiative, along with their results and impacts.

## 1. Twitter Activity

I created a Twitter account for Autonomys, active since August, with the aim of reaching and engaging the Portuguese-speaking audience. Through this account, I posted various threads to:

- Disseminate relevant information about the protocol and community activities.
- Engage and expand participation among Portuguese speakers.
- Stimulate constructive discussions and feedback.

- Ensuring the content is presented in a language that is closer and easier to understand for our target audience.
- Expanding the reach and communication of the translated materials, thereby facilitating engagement and knowledge-sharing.

These efforts have contributed to strengthening the Autonomys community and demonstrate my commitment to supporting initiatives that drive the project to new levels.
